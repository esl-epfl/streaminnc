# StreamiNNC for accelerometry-based seizure detection

For the data and the pretrained network weights please contact Prof. Philippe Ryvlin (philippe.ryvlin@chuv.ch).

Data should be placed in the ```./data``` folder and the network weights in the ```./saved_models```.

The C++11 implementation is located [here](./c%2B%2B11/README.md).
