# StreamiNNC for Electroencephalography-based seizure detection

The [CHB-MIT dataset](https://physionet.org/content/chbmit/1.0.0/) is used for these experiments.

For preparing the data and training the original full inference network please refer to [Personalized Online Seizure Detection](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/ashahbaz/personalized-online-seizure-detection).

The trained network weights can then be placed in the ```./saved_models``` directory. The preprocessed data should be placed in the ```./data``` folder.
